## Development Plan for Warpath: Ace Shooter Clone

### Phase 1: MVP Development

**Objective**: Create a MVP focusing on land combat, base building mechanics, and basic UI.

#### Key Features:
1. **Land Combat Mechanics**:
   - Implement tile-based troop positioning and movement.
   - Create combat interactions and animations for land vehicles and soldiers.

2. **Base Building Mechanics**:
   - Design a grid-based construction system for building and upgrading military bases with drag-and-drop functionality.

   - Develop interactive building placement with preview, rotation options, and construction time mechanics.

3. **Basic UI and Game Flow**:
   - Design and implement the main menu, settings, and in-game HUD with intuitive navigation and responsive design.
   - Develop basic tutorials with hand gesture sprites and arrow markers to guide new players through core mechanics.
   - Implement player profile and inventory management systems with customizable avatars.

#### Development Practices:
- **Version Control**: Utilize Git for source code management and collaboration, with branching strategies for feature development.
- **Modular Design**: Develop modular components for easy maintenance and scalability, using design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller).
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for code and design decisions, including API references and user guides.



### Phase 2: Full Game Development

**Objective**: Expand the game to include water-related combat, shooting missions, and complete the game as per "Warpath."

#### Key Features:
1. **Water Combat Mechanics**:
   - Implement naval battles with warships, submarines, and aircraft carriers, including boarding actions and ship-to-ship combat.
   - Develop water-based troop and vehicle interaction and movements.
   - Create realistic water physics and effects, including waves, currents, and weather impacts..

2. **Shooting Missions**:
   - Design and implement various shooting missions with objectives and rewards, including stealth, assault, and defense scenarios.
   - Develop slodiers and base for enemy factions, with mission-specific challenges and adaptive difficulty levels.
   - Integrate diverse weapon systems with upgradeable components, including attachments, skins, and performance enhancements.

3. **Complete UI and Game Flow**:
   - Enhance UI with detailed sprites for all game elements, including dynamic elements like health bars and ammo counters.
   - Implement advanced tutorials and help systems with context-sensitive tips and interactive guides.
   - Develop a comprehensive game flow with story progression, mission branching, and player choice impacts on the narrative.
