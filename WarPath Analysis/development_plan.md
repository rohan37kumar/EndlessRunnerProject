    - Implement combat interactions for land vehicles and soldiers.
    - Integrate basic combat animations and effects.

- **Week 5**:
  - **UI Development**:
    - Implement main menu, settings, and in-game HUD.
    - Develop responsive UI elements.
    - Create scripts for UI navigation and interaction.

- **Week 6**:
  - **Resource Management**:
    - Finalize resource nodes and storage buildings.
    - Implement resource gathering and usage mechanics.
    - Develop scripts for resource tracking and updates.

- **Week 7**:
  - **Testing and Debugging**:
    - Debug and optimize game performance.

- **Week 8**:
  - **Tutorials and Finalization**:
    - Develop basic tutorials with hand gesture sprites and arrow markers.
    - Implement player profile and inventory management systems.
    - Conduct final testing and prepare for MVP release.

#### Key Features:
1. **Land Combat Mechanics**:
   - Implement tile-based troop positioning and movement.
   - Create combat interactions and animations for land vehicles and soldiers.

2. **Base Building Mechanics**:
   - Design a grid-based construction system for building and upgrading military bases with drag-and-drop functionality.
   - Implement resource collection and management (e.g., metal, oil, wood) with resource nodes and storage buildings.
   - Develop interactive building placement with preview, rotation options, and construction time mechanics.

3. **Basic UI and Game Flow**:
   - Design and implement the main menu, settings, and in-game HUD with intuitive navigation and responsive design.
   - Develop basic tutorials with hand gesture sprites and arrow markers to guide new players through core mechanics.
   - Implement player profile and inventory management systems with customizable avatars.

#### Development Practices:
- **Version Control**: Utilize Git for source code management and collaboration, with branching strategies for feature development.
- **Modular Design**: Develop modular components for easy maintenance and scalability, using design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller).
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for code and design decisions, including API references and user guides.


### Phase 2: Full Game Development

**Objective**: Expand the game to include water-related combat, shooting missions, and complete the game as per "Warpath."

#### Timeline: 4 Weeks

- **Week 9**:
  - **Water Combat Mechanics**:
    - Implement naval battles with warships, submarines, and aircraft carriers.
    - Develop water physics and effects using shaders and particle systems.
    - Create scripts for water-based troop and vehicle interactions.

- **Week 10**:
  - **Shooting Missions**:
    - Design and implement various shooting missions with objectives and rewards.
    - Develop mission-specific AI and adaptive difficulty levels.
    - Integrate diverse weapon systems with upgradeable components.

- **Week 11**:
  - **UI and Game Flow Enhancements**:
    - Enhance UI with detailed sprites for all game elements.
    - Implement advanced tutorials and help systems with context-sensitive tips.
    - Develop comprehensive game flow with story progression and mission branching.

- **Week 12**:
  - **Final Testing and Optimization**:
    - Conduct comprehensive testing and optimization for all game features.
    - Implement final adjustments based on feedback.
    - Prepare for full game release and post-launch support.
